## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the power of data visualization in conveying insights from financial data. By using matplotlib, a popular data visualization library in Python, we analyze and visualize the euro-dollar exchange rates. The project focuses on three main narratives: the impact of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, and a comparison of exchange rates under different US presidents.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical euro-dollar exchange rates from 1999 to 2020. The data is sourced from [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html).

## Installation

To run the code locally and generate the visualizations, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/vajrastra/Storytelling-Data-Visualization-on-Exchange-Rates.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Storytelling-Data-Visualization-on-Exchange-Rates`
3. Install the required packages using Anaconda or pip: `conda install matplotlib pandas` or `pip install matplotlib pandas`
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to generate the visualizations.

## Usage

- The main code file is `data_visualization.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook).
- Alternatively, you can use the `data_visualization.py` script (Python script).

## Visualizations

1. **Financial Crisis Example**: Visualizes how the euro-dollar rate changed during the 2007-2008 financial crisis, highlighting key events and the peak of the crisis.

2. **Three US Presidencies Example**: Compares euro-dollar exchange rates under the last three US presidents: George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump.

For detailed visualizations and explanations, refer to the code and comments in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
